Get two go routines to play tennis, - ping pong game-  challenge to understand the concept of concurrency and sharing data.


Hi everyone ü§ó , I hope you had an awesome weekend!


Be that as it may today I am going to share a piece of code though a part - it's easy to get the other part because it is almost a duplicate.


The code showcases the following 


1Ô∏è‚É£ How to get go routines running.


2Ô∏è‚É£ How to cancel go routines using context.


3Ô∏è‚É£ The importance of a closed channel.


4Ô∏è‚É£ How to check if the channel is closed


5Ô∏è‚É£ why channels are awesome as a means of communication for goroutines.


Anyways the code gets to play tennis for us üòé !


Concurrency can be tricky business, coz a lot can go wrong like:


‚ùå closing the channel at the wrong place(or forgetting to close it all together)

‚ùå failing to check whether the channel is closed

‚ùå failing to close the go routine when done(forget to use wg.Done())

‚ùå forgetting wg.Wait()


these four might seem trivial, but make them and you have a deadlock!
