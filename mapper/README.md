Golang is awesome at dealing with data

hi everyone ðŸ¤— , I hope you are doing great!

this piece of code 

```bash
    mapper := make(Results)
    // group data with levels
    for _, employee := range employees {
    mapper[employee.Seniority] = append(mapper[employee.Seniority], employee)
    }
```
from the screenshot below, just grouped data into levels- simple and direct!

That's it for today

Are you a gopher now?
