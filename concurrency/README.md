hashtag#QuizThursday: Concurrency Gotchas in Go 👨‍💻🐹

Hello, everyone! 🤗 Let's dive into common concurrency pitfalls in Go and how to handle them.

Concurrency Problems to Watch Out For:

1️⃣ Race Conditions: Unprotected reads/writes.
⚡ Use the -race flag to detect them.

2️⃣ Deadlocks: When goroutines can't progress.
⚡ Ensure proper locking and avoid circular waits.

3️⃣ Goroutine Leaks: Goroutines hanging on blocked or empty channels.
⚡ Use pprof to detect leaks. Always have a clear exit strategy for goroutines.

4️⃣ Channel Errors:
⚡ Examples: Closing a channel twice, sending to a closed channel, receiving from or closing a nil channel.

5️⃣ Sync Package Misuse:

💥 WaitGroups:
- Forgetting wg.Add(), wg.Done(), or wg.Wait().

💥 Mutexes:
- Always defer unlocks to avoid issues.
- Use a consistent lock/unlock order to prevent deadlocks when using multiple mutexes.

⚡ Pro Tip: Leaking goroutines? Buffered channels can sometimes help, especially for those accustomed to unbuffered ones.

Stay aware of these pitfalls, and you'll handle Go concurrency like a pro! 🚀

Happy Holidays! 🎉
